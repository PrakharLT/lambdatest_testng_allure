Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment** i.e. **JDK 1.6** or higher. We recommend using the latest version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven** which supports **JUnit** framework out of the box. **Maven** can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

### Cloning Repo And Installing Dependencies

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s Java-TestNG-Selenium repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Java-TestNG-Selenium
cd Java-TestNG-Selenium
```

You can also run the command below to check for outdated dependencies.

```bash
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts. You can get these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Java-TestNG-Selenium) or by your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=Java-TestNG-Selenium).

**Step 2:** Set LambdaTest **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

* For **Linux/macOS**:
  
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
